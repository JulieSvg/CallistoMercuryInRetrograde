      The story of a masked, moon-protecting, warrior goddess from the Bicol
      region doesn't come from authentic pre-colonial lore. It traces back to
      the early 1990s, when a passage describing a ritual dance called Haleya
      was misread as referring to a deity. That mistake snowballed: a blog in
      the early 2000s repeated the claim, mixing it with shaky sources, and the
      invented 'myth' spread from there. Sadly, much of our pre-Spanish history
      was suppressed as 'heretical' and destroyed, so genuine records are
      scarce. Our writing systems were nearly lost, but recent efforts have
      begun to recover and reintegrate them into Filipino culture.

      Because of the misinterpretation as well as the nature of myths, there are
      multiple versions and retellings of this story. The following story is my
      personal favorite version of this modern myth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long ago seven radiant moons lit the night, each a living deity. From the
      ocean depths, Bakunawa, once a sea maiden, grew jealous of their splendor
      and especially of the handsome moon Bulan. Twisting herself into a vast
      serpent-dragon, she flew into the sky and swallowed the moons one by one,
      but each melted away inside her like wax. Furious, the high god Bathala
      bound Bakunawa to her monstrous form and forbade her to devour the last
      two moons. Undeterred, she attacked again, but this time Haliya was
      prepared. Wearing a golden mask to hide her beauty, the moon goddess
      faught Bakunawa, protecting her last sibling, until she drove the serpent
      back into the abyss. Now, whenever Bakunawa resurfaces—marked by a lunar
      eclipse and the moon's crimson hue—people on earth beat gongs, clash pots,
      and play music to frighten or lull her until she spits the moon out,
      preserving the sky's remaining light.
