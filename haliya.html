            <h3>Mythology and Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              Because of the misinterpretation as well as the nature of myths, there are multiple versions and retellings of this story. The following story is my personal favorite version of this modern myth.
            </p>
            <p>Myths that surround Haliya:</p>
            <div class="list-origin-chandra">
              
                <p>
                  Long ago seven radiant moons lit the night, each a living deity. From
                  the ocean depths, Bakunawa, once a sea maiden, grew jealous of their
                  splendor and especially of the handsome moon Bulan. Twisting herself
                  into a vast serpent-dragon, she flew into the sky and swallowed the
                  moons one by one, but each melted away inside her like wax. Furious, the
                  high god Bathala bound Bakunawa to her monstrous form and forbade her to
                  devour the last two moons. Undeterred, she attacked again, but this time
                  Haliya was prepared. Wearing a golden mask to hide her beauty, the moon
                  goddess faught Bakunawa, protecting her last sibling, until she drove
                  the serpent back into the abyss. Now, whenever Bakunawa
                  resurfaces—marked by a lunar eclipse and the moon's crimson hue—people
                  on earth beat gongs, clash pots, and play music to frighten or lull her
                  until she spits the moon out, preserving the sky's remaining light.
