## Final Project

### Project Summary

Our website will explore the moon deities from various ancient cultures, analyzing their origins, stories, and roles in mythology. We aim to provide an informative and interactive experience highlighting the similarities and differences between these celestial figures across civilizations. We decided to explore this theme because one of our team members was interested in doing something related to the Filipino goddess of the moon. This inspired us to create a website showcasing how different cultures have their own lunar deities, each with unique yet overlapping traits.
