## Final Project

### Project Summary

Our website will explore the moon deities from various ancient cultures, analyzing their origins, stories, and roles in mythology. We aim to provide an informative and interactive experience highlighting the similarities and differences between these celestial figures across civilizations. We decided to explore this theme because one of our team members was interested in doing something related to the Filipino goddess of the moon. This inspired us to create a website showcasing how different cultures have their own lunar deities, each with unique yet overlapping traits.

### Key Takeaways

Understanding of why we are doing this project
We are doing this project in order to demonstrate the skills we have learned in class, as well as to educate others about our topic. We have shown use of several different coding languages, including Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will also introduce the topic of cultural deities of the moon to our readers. We will demonstrate that we have learned how to use each of these languages with eachother to create a visually appealing website that also has unique functionality.

### Core Webpages

Home Page - Cultural Dieties of the Moon: Similarities and Differences
This page will introduce a handful of ancient astral dieties from different cultures, and their origins.

Lore Page - Origins and cultures
This page will discuss all of the dieties and how the cultures that they were associated with established their overall story, abilities, historical background and roles in that cultures nature.

Comparison Page - Comparing and Contrasting
This page will dive into which cultures may have similar beliefs in how these dieties work. It will discuss the many differences, as well as
finding data that is complementary between cultures. It will also discuss the idea of one diety with different names in differing cultures and religions.

Poll Page - Who's your favorite?
This page will be an interactive page including all the names of the dieties and their main qualities and powers, and will encourage the viewer to pick their favorite and vote for them on a poll within the sight. This information will then be sent to the server for data analysis.

### Design Choices

The visuals on these websites are really good, and the way they styled them keeps the pages looking interesting, with typically soft warm colors for backgrounds/images, while using white/bright colored fonts for the text. They also tend to keep the text pretty bold, which makes the text easier to read, too.
