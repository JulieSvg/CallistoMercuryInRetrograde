          Chandra, also known as Soma, is the celestial deity representing the
          Moon in Hindu mythology. Revered across Indian religious traditions
          (Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism—Chandra), he symbolizes illumination,
          calmness, emotional depth, and the cyclical rhythm of time. His
          presence is integral to stories of creation, cosmic balance, and
          divine intervention.

        <h2>Mythology and Origin Story</h2>
        <p>
          Chandra’s origins trace back to Vedic literature, where he is praised
          in the Rig Veda as the essence of Soma, the sacred nectar of the gods,
          and the nurturer of flora. Born from the mind of the primordial being
          (as per Purusha Sukta), Chandra is intimately connected to thoughts,
          emotions, and speech, earning the title Vachaspati (Lord of Speech).
