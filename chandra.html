        Chandra, also known as Soma, is the celestial deity representing the
        Moon in Hindu mythology. Revered across Indian religious traditions
        (Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism—Chandra), he symbolizes illumination,
        calmness, emotional depth, and the cyclical rhythm of time. His presence
        is integral to stories of creation, cosmic balance, and divine
        intervention.

            <h3>Mythology and Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              Chandra’s origins trace back to Vedic literature, where he is
              praised in the Rig Veda as the essence of Soma, the sacred nectar
              of the gods, and the nurturer of flora. Born from the mind of the
              primordial being (as per Purusha Sukta), Chandra is intimately
              connected to thoughts, emotions, and speech, earning the title
              Vachaspati (Lord of Speech).

                    <span class="bold-chandra">Birth and Power:</span> Chandra
                    was born to sage Atri and Anusuya and given dominion over
                    the Moon, becoming part of the Navagraha (nine celestial
                    influencers).

                    <span class="bold-chandra">Chandra and Tara:</span>
                    He fell in love with Tara, the wife of Brihaspati (Jupiter),
                    resulting in the birth of Budha (Mercury). This love
                    triangle led to celestial tensions and added to Chandra’s
                    mythic complexity.

                    >
                    Chandra married 27 daughters of Daksha, representing the
                    lunar constellations (Nakshatras), but showed favoritism to
                    Rohini. Cursed by Daksha for his neglect of the other wives,
                    Chandra began to wane—giving rise to the lunar phases.
