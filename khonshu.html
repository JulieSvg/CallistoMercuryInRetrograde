        Khonshu (also remembered as Khons, Chons, and Khensu) is known as the
        Egyptian God of the moon and time. He was primarily celebrated in the
        former city-state Thebes, where he was acknowledged for his influence on
        fertility; livestock and people thrived on this notion. Additionally,
        stories mention Khonshu having a primarily role in the creation of the
        universe.

            <h3>Mythology and Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              In early stories about Khonshu, he wasn't remembered as being an all giving God. On the contrary, he was remembered as being bloodthirsty and dangerous. He would work hand-in-hand with the deceased king to capture, kill, and feed on other gods in order to take their strength for himself, being known in the Coffin Texts as "Khonshu who lives on hearts". As the New Kingdom developed, however, things took a turn in which the people considered him the "Greatest God of Gods", and associated him with being actually quite compassionate. He offered great protection for the people, their livestock, and their lands. Additionally, stories describe him to have healed the pharoah Ptolemy IV, where they say he cleansed him of evil spirits. This time period is also when his name was officially defined as to travel and to cross, referencing his travels across the night sky.</p>

                    was born to sage Atri and Anusuya and given dominion over
                    the Moon, becoming part of the Navagraha (nine celestial
                    influencers).

                   He fell in love with Tara, the wife of Brihaspati (Jupiter),
                    resulting in the birth of Budha (Mercury). This love
                    triangle led to celestial tensions and added to Chandra’s
                    mythic complexity.

                  Chandra married 27 daughters of Daksha, representing the
                    lunar constellations (Nakshatras), but showed favoritism to
                    Rohini. Cursed by Daksha for his neglect of the other wives,
                    Chandra began to wane, giving rise to the lunar phases.

          <h3>Iconography and Symbols</h3>
          <p>
            Chandra is portrayed as a fair, youthful deity with a serene
              expression, riding a chariot drawn by ten white horses or geese.
              Sometimes, he’s shown seated on a lotus atop his chariot.

            In Buddhist art, particularly from the Newar tradition of Nepal,
              Chandra is occasionally featured in mandalas, though more often as
              a secondary figure rather than a central deity.

          <h3>Temples</h3>
          <p>
            Though not as prominently worshipped as deities like Shiva or
              Vishnu, Chandra has sacred associations:
          </p>
          <div class="list-origin-chandra">

                    According to legend, Chandra was saved from Daksha’s curse
                    by Shiva here, earning the deity the name Chandrashekhara
                    (He who wears the moon).

                    >
                    Originating from the mythical site where Chandra was split
                    by Brahma, the river symbolizes both spiritual cleansing and
                    the harmony of masculine and feminine forces.
