        Across cultures and time periods, moon deities have held a prominent
        place in mythology, often representing cycles of time, feminine energy,
        and the mysteries of the night sky. Revered for their connection to the
        natural world, these lunar gods and goddesses embody themes of
        transformation, intuition, and fertility. From the goddess Haliya in
        Filipino mythology to the powerful god Chandra in Hinduism, the moon has
        been a source of awe and reverence, influencing rituals, calendars, and
        cultural beliefs. These dieties not only illuminate the night but also
        reflect humanity's enduring fascination with the celestial and the
        divine.

      <h3>Haliya: Filipino goddess of the Moon</h3>
      <section id="flexbox">
        <p>
          Haliya is a moon goddess in Filipino mythology, particularly within
          the Bicolano culture. She is often depicted as a beautiful and radiant
          deity who embodies the moons calm and nurturing qualities. Haliya is
          also associated with the night sky, and in some stories, she is said
          to be the sister of the sun god Bathala. In one myth, Haliya is said
          to have been shunned by her brother and hides herself in the moon to
          escape his harsh light. Her stories often reflect themes of beauty,
          isolation, and the cyclical nature of the moon. Haliya's role as a
          protector of the night sky underscores the Filipino belief in the
          power and majesty of celestial forces.

      <h3>Chandra: Hindu god of the Moon</h3>
      <section id="flexbox2">
        <p>
          Chandra is the Hindu god of the moon, often depicted as a beautiful,
          fair, and wise deity who rides a chariot pulled by white horses. He is
          associated with the mind, emotions, and fertility, and plays an
          important role in both mythology and astrology. Chandra is also one of
          the Navagrahas (nine planetary deities) and is linked to the lunar
          calendar in Hindu tradition. He is said to be the father of Budha (the
          planet Mercury) and is married to the 27 Nakshatras (lunar mansions),
          who are daughters of the sage Daksha.

      <h3>Kuutar: Finnish goddess of the Moon</h3>
      <section id="flexbox3">
        <p>
          Kuutar is the Finnish goddess of the moon in Finnish mythology and
          folklore. She is known for her beauty and grace, and she weaves golden
          threads and clothes from moonlight. Kuutar is associated with
          femininity, wealth, and the mystical qualities of the moon. In the
          Kalevala, Finland's national epic, maidens pray to her for beauty and
          fine garments. She represents the nurturing and magical aspects of the
          moon. This image depicts her with sun goddess Paivatar and star
          goddess Tahdetar.

      <h3>Khonshu: Egyptian god of the Moon</h3>
      <section id="flexbox4">
        <p>
          Khonshu is the ancient Egyptian god of the moon, time, and healing.
          Often depicted as a young man with a sidelock of youth and a moon disk
          above his head, he was believed to control the night and mark the
          passage of time. Khonshu was also associated with protection and had
          healing powers. He was worshipped as the son of Amun and Mut in the
          Theban triad and played an important role in lunar and
          calendar-related rituals. His name means “traveler,” reflecting the
          moon's journey across the sky.
