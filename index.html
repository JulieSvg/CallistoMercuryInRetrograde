        Across cultures and time periods, moon deities have held a prominent
        place in mythology, often representing cycles of time, feminine energy,
        and the mysteries of the night sky. Revered for their connection to the
        natural world, these lunar gods and goddesses embody themes of
        transformation, intuition, and fertility. From the goddess Haliya in
        Filipino mythology to the powerful god Chandra in Hinduism, the moon has
        been a source of awe and reverence, influencing rituals, calendars, and
        cultural beliefs. These dieties not only illuminate the night but also
        reflect humanity's enduring fascination with the celestial and the
        divine.

        <h3>Haliya: Filipino goddess of the Moon</h3>
        <section id="flexbox">
          <p>
            Haliya is the moon's armored guardian: a warrior goddess who masks
            her radiant beauty with gold, wields a crescent blade, and defends
            the sky against Bakunawa—the sea-serpent that tries to swallow the
            moon during eclipses. Each time the dragon rises, Haliya meets it in
            fierce combat and through her vigilance and courage, the last moon's
            light endures.

        <h3>Chandra: Hindu god of the Moon</h3>
        <section id="flexbox2">
          <p>
            Chandra is the Hindu god of the moon, often depicted as a beautiful,
            fair, and wise deity who rides a chariot pulled by white horses. He
            is associated with the mind, emotions, and fertility, and plays an
            important role in both mythology and astrology. Chandra is also one
            of the Navagrahas (nine planetary deities) and is linked to the
            lunar calendar in Hindu tradition. He is said to be the father of
            Budha (the planet Mercury) and is married to the 27 Nakshatras
            (lunar mansions), who are daughters of the sage Daksha.

        <h3>Kuutar: Finnish goddess of the Moon</h3>
        <section id="flexbox3">
          <p>
            Kuutar is the Finnish goddess of the moon in Finnish mythology and
            folklore. She is known for her beauty and grace, and she weaves
            golden threads and clothes from moonlight. Kuutar is associated with
            femininity, wealth, and the mystical qualities of the moon. In the
            Kalevala, Finland's national epic, maidens pray to her for beauty
            and fine garments. She represents the nurturing and magical aspects
            of the moon. This image depicts her with sun goddess Paivatar and
            star goddess Tahdetar.

        <h3>Khonshu: Egyptian god of the Moon</h3>
        <section id="flexbox4">
          <p>
            Khonshu is the ancient Egyptian god of the moon, time, and healing.
            Often depicted as a young man with a sidelock of youth and a moon
            disk above his head, he was believed to control the night and mark
            the passage of time. Khonshu was also associated with protection and
            had healing powers. He was worshipped as the son of Amun and Mut in
            the Theban triad and played an important role in lunar and
            calendar-related rituals. His name means “traveler,” reflecting the
            moon's journey across the sky.
