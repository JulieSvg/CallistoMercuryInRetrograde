        Across cultures and time periods, moon deities have held a prominent
        place in mythology, often representing cycles of time, feminine energy,
        and the mysteries of the night sky. Revered for their connection to the
        natural world, these lunar gods and goddesses embody themes of
        transformation, intuition, and fertility. From the goddess Haliya in
        Filipino mythology to the powerful god Chandra in Hinduism, the moon has
        been a source of awe and reverence, influencing rituals, calendars, and
        cultural beliefs. These dieties not only illuminate the night but also
        reflect humanity's enduring fascination with the celestial and the
        divine.

      <h3>Haliya: Filipino goddess of the Moon</h3>
      <section id="flexbox">
        <p>
          Haliya is a moon goddess in Filipino mythology, particularly within
          the Bicolano culture. She is often depicted as a beautiful and radiant
          deity who embodies the moons calm and nurturing qualities. Haliya is
          also associated with the night sky, and in some stories, she is said
          to be the sister of the sun god Bathala. In one myth, Haliya is said
          to have been shunned by her brother and hides herself in the moon to
          escape his harsh light. Her stories often reflect themes of beauty,
          isolation, and the cyclical nature of the moon. Haliya's role as a
          protector of the night sky underscores the Filipino belief in the
          power and majesty of celestial forces.
